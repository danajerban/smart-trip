To run this you will need your own API keys (they are all free) because of the restrictions I have put,
because I had problems with .env for some reason.

Enjoy!

npm run:start backend -> starts server, listening at port 8000
npm run:start frontend -> starts this create-my-react app

-JS initially then refactored in TS

Explore is like the app for the components in folders - contains all the props to pass down to them
Chat is its own component - for simplicity and also did this on side, and then connected everything together
The profiles, signin, sign out, etc are all at pages folder
css is a bit of a mess because what i did is basically join 3 apps into 1 (map, chat & profile/auth)
