# Smart Trip

Smart Trip is the **initial prototype** of a travel assistant application designed to revolutionize vacation planning. Much like renowned platforms such as TripAdvisor, Smart Trip offers insights on top-rated hotels, restaurants, and must-see tourist spots. However, what sets this application apart is its integration with OpenAI technology and Google Places/Maps. This integration empowers users to effortlessly identify the prime attractions in a given city, craft tailored itineraries based on the duration of their stay, and optimize their overall vacation planning experience.
